Airtable make it super easy to make launch sheet for your VA

1. write \[va1\] in campaign notes _\( or on account notes, if you want to share on account level \)_

### Ad spend

You want your VA to report the spending per account per campaign. Ideally we would do this from the API but since accounts generally have short live span and using API leave fingerprint, you have to report manually. \( Could make it work with email report that fb send like Kowboykit if you need \)

1. Share the ad spend form with your VA
2. VA fill spend per campaign per day

The spend will show in the stats and will show CPC, CPL, ROI, SPEND

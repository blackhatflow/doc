Case study

## Crypto DE + FB

This post show the steps to make a campaign on FB CRYPTO DE/AU/CH \( all these countries speak dutch so we can push them to same offers \) This is one of the first post on FB, so i will details the step a bit more and keep it updated with what's missing.

We will see how to :

1. make your [campaign link](crypto_de_fb.md#campaign) on blackflow and set a [safe page](crypto_de_fb.md#lander),
2. [build the ad](crypto_de_fb.md#ad) on fb
3. use the [pixel](crypto_de_fb.md#pixel)
4. then [optimize](crypto_de_fb.md#optimize) and see our [recommendations](crypto_de_fb.md#recommendations)
5. Also showing you some [issues](crypto_de_fb.md#issue) i had to help you running your account

### Preparation

#### campaign

### Pixel

Once you get some data you can create a custom conversion, as follows :

Then you need to add your ad account to get access to the custom conversions.

Then you can make your campaign with Objective set as Conversions

Then make a few adset with conversion set as time\_120s \( Leads are a much better event to optimize on, but remember here we don't have enought data to feed facebook. Time 120s is just the fastest way to optimize and get feedback \)

Targeting..

For placements, it seems the most converting in term of CR is destkop traffic. Now of course you have to factor that in your CPC.. mobile is working too, lower CR but lower CPC as well. Another note is that sidebar ads don't have user comments, so it's less converting, a bit cheaper and maybe safer... again this is up to you, no rules here.

So i ended up with two adset. Turn out the adset with time 240s at objective didn't have enough data and performed badly.

### Issue

Posting the issues i had when uploading the ads.

It's an art here, to convey the right message to your audience without getting flagged as a make money sheme.

What to do if your account get banned ?

First step is to archive the campaign so it return a blank page instead, then appeal your account. Say hello, be extra polite go a long way when you send your message.

"Hi there, it seems our account got disabled by mistake. Could you have a second look? Thanks, have a nice day"

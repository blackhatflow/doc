# ðŸ”¨ Account Ban

Google and facebook have 100x reasons to ban your account, let's write a bit about why it usually happens and what you can do about it. \( This is based on our experience, nothing more \) 

## Google

As you ca see only about 20% of the ban would be about the cloaker itself. The main reason are your account quality and ad settings.

          <li>if it happen after spending, then it&apos;s probably the cloaker at fault
            that didn&apos;t filter the reviewer visit</li>

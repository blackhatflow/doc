Case study

# Crypto DE + FB

This post show the steps to make a campaign on FB CRYPTO DE/AU/CH ( all these countries speak dutch so we can push them to same offers ) 
This is one of the first post on FB, so i will details the step a bit more and keep it updated with what's missing.

<u>We will see how to :</u>

1. intro

2. make your [campaign link](#campaign) on blackflow and set a [safe page](#lander), 

3. [build the ad](#ad) on fb

4. use the [pixel](#pixel)

5. then [optimize](#optimize) and see our [recommendations](#recommendations)

6. Also showing you some [issues](#issue) i had to help you running your account

## Intro

So facebook is beast on his own. Things changed a lot, you can't expect to launch dirty ads, get it live and even make any money on it.

My background is facebook arbitrage, so i've been playing with high volume, low cpc and pixel a lot, so in my view this is the key. Every targeting settings you add in term of interest/audience raise your CPC. So the stragegy i recommend is settings up a broad targeting and let the pixel do the work. 

By broad targeting, i mean to not select any interest, just keep it to the country/device and maybe gender/age that you want. What i do is DE/AU/CH + desktop + newsfeed/ sidebar + male 35+ . Again feel free to try anything, i just recommend to keep it broad. yes result will be bad at the beginning.

Then for the angle you usually get to choose between two options : Indirect ( celebrity ect.. ) or direct ( trading, makes money )

It's up to you to be creative and to be subtle enough to suggest your audience this is going to be an "easy hack to make quick money quickly"

So we talked about targeting, angle, now let's set up the pixel : 

When you launch on a new account, you set up a new pixel and you have no data yet. So you need to create a Traffic campaign first to get some data. Keep your angle safe, no need to be agressive here, we are just warming up.

I don't recommend warming up on a different domain / page like, but everyone his own way. 

Run a a bit of traffic budget 20$ and turn on the campaign on blackflow after a day or two to get some data. ( Day 1 : OFF . Day 2 : OFF, Day 3 ON getting traffic data)
Then as we get some data and events, you can now create custom conversion. We need to see a least a a few time120s, time 180s and leads to start with.

So the pixel fire the event ** time 120s** quite quickly ( which mean people are staying on the page at least 2min ) and we can use that to make a new campaign with objective set on Conversion. Then make your adset on time_120s ( custom conversion that we previously created ). 

As you get more and more data, spending > 100$ ( don't expect any good result until this point ), you can finally start to make adset that optimize on Leads ( our second custom conversion we created ). By the way, what we call Leads on blackflow are click that have high chance of converting. We aways update the definition ( we do some ML here as it depends on landers, geo and as we get more and more data ), but currently a lead is defined by click time > 140s and scroll > 50%

As you let facebook optimize, keep a low budget 50-100$ and you will see your cost per conversion ( leads ) drop over the next fews days. A reasonnable target is \$20-25. Once you are below that you can start to raise budget and scale.
Don't forget to check comments on your ads if you were targeting on news feed ( user can't comment on sidebar ads )

Another note on scaling. Things are always changing ( lately fb switch to campaign optimization ) but so far from my experience, the result can be really different from two exact same adset.. So sometime it make sense to duplicate your wining adset 3 times, each with 50\$ budget and scale the winning adset. 

## Preparation

#### campaign

## Pixel

Once you get some data you can create a custom conversion, as follows :

Then you need to add your ad account to get access to the custom conversions.

Then you can make your campaign with Objective set as Conversions

Then make a few adset with conversion set as time_120s ( Leads are a much better event to optimize on, but remember here we don't have enought data to feed facebook. Time 120s is just the fastest way to optimize and get feedback )

Targeting..

![Screen Shot 2020-02-21 at 10.15.30 AM.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackhatflow/storage/master/2020/02/21-10-17-07-Screen%20Shot%202020-02-21%20at%2010.15.30%20AM.png)

For placements, it seems the most converting in term of CR is destkop traffic. Now of course you have to factor that in your CPC.. mobile is working too, lower CR but lower CPC as well. 
Another note is that sidebar ads don't have user comments, so it's less converting, a bit cheaper and maybe safer... again this is up to you, no rules here.

So i ended up with two adset. Turn out the adset with time 240s at objective didn't have enough data and performed badly.

## Issue

Posting the issues i had when uploading the ads.

It's an art here, to convey the right message to your audience without getting flagged as a make money sheme.

What to do if your account get banned ? 

First step is to archive the campaign so it return a blank page instead, then appeal your account. Say hello, be extra polite go a long way when you send your message.

"Hi there, it seems our account got disabled by mistake. Could you have a second look? Thanks, have a nice day"

## Optimizing cost and conversion

#### Bid

usually you want to cap your max cpc, as google can get very expensive.

What we currently recommend for UK is setting max cpc at 0.5\$ and adjust the bid for desktop up to 1\$ as destkop convert 2-3x better than mobile.

#### Cost per conversion

After you set up pixel, you should see conversion appear on your adword account.
We fire these conv everytime we detect a click to offer with strong intent ( time >2min )

We call these lead, and they usually convert into Offer Lead ( signup  )

To recap : Lander lead ( good click ) -> Offer conv ( Signup) -> FTD ( deposit money )

You need to compare the cost per conv, with the stats we provide

You need to compare the cost per conv, with the general stats we provide

So it's seems above that my current cost per lead is too high 31$ > 26\$ but for mobile it's good, 4.5\$ < 12\$ ( 300% ROI )

What to do with these data? 

There are just early feedback, it's very early to conclude anything. Just use it as an indicator as if you are on the right track ( because sometime the way to the 700\$ FTD is long ). So don't take any harsh decision based on it.

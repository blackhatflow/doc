# Case study Crypto UK on Taboola VoluumDSP

Notes :

VoluumDSP is very picky regarding compliance with taboola.

They don't accept anything affiliate like VSL, news website etc.. Anything related to finance, trading, forex is not allowed either.

Think about it like it's facebook.

## Find a safe page

The first step is to think about your ad angle and find a congruent safe page 

You have many options for safe page methods, can be any website but curl probaly won't work as they manually review.

### Angle

My angle will be sports car.

Here are the headlines i think about : 

This guy finally drive his dream car with this...

Looks rich, and make your dream come true'

This is the easy way to get a supercar

Rent super car in London

The point is to trigger interest about something that looks like a hack, an easy way to get money or to look rich.

The headline *Rent super car in London* is just hear to make our campaign look legit, we will not pause the create right after it get approved.

### safe page

After a quick google search, i will use this website.

https://starrluxurycars.com/

starrluxurycars

Lets screenshot the logo as we will need it later

Let's add the domain to blackflow, so we can use it as safe page

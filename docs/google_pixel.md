## GoogleAds Pixel

### setting up the pixel

We will set up two conversions : 

- **[Lead](#Lead)** : it will fire automatically from our **Website**

- **[Purchase](#Purchase)** : you will **import manually** the conv later on ( we can't fire pixel for ftd or offer lead for now )

### 1) **Lead** :

 *will fire automatically from the lander, when we detect the click to offer is good quality ( time on page > 120s + scroll +50%. )* **Avg Lead to Offer Lead is 50%**

1. Choose Website

2. keep note of the ***conversion ID*** ( associated to your googleads account ) and ***conversion Label*** ( specific to that conversion event )

3. Set up pixel on blackflow: On your ad account on blackflow, enter this as pixel :

    `{conversion ID}-{Conversion Label}`

     in this example, it looks like this:

    `685124755-iAofCJ_D2LcBEJPZ2MYC`

### 2) **Purchase**

we will import them manually in case of FTD ( first time deposit ). We don't need any conversion ID here, but the name ***conv*** matter!

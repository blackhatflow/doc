### Optimize on lead

![Screen Shot 2020-01-23 at 8.05.08 PM.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackhatflow/storage/master/2020/01/29-10-30-13-Screen%20Shot%202020-01-23%20at%208.05.08%20PM.png)

What's new with blackflow is our new metric "lead".

Because user clicks on your lander can be accidental, it ends up not meaning much in term of data. So at blackflow, what we call lead is a click with good intent, defined by: click time &gt;2min + scroll page &gt; 50%

The benefit here is that instead of optimizing on FTD \( 700$ \) or offer lead/conversion that very high value, **you can accurately optimize on Lead value**, which is much faster data to get.

For example, you spend 200$ on google, and still not FTDs.. you worry about if something is wrong.. Now that you have **lead value**, you see that you actually made 10 leads on mobile and 4 on desktop, which are worth 10x15$ + 4x50$ = 350$ . Congrats you are on the right track!

As for now we provide average lead value based on Geo, Device, and click time.

As we get more data we will provide deeper breakdown.

### Smarter funnel

Most affiliates promoting crypto are not putting the effort to match the offer screenshot on the lander. Instead they are using outdated image, even in the wrong country currency...

Other vertical like nutra or sweeptakes have since long time optimized their lander to match the country or ISP.

So blackflow funnel got smarter for crypto too! the step1, step2, step3 images on the lander now dynamically match the offer.

The benefit is that it's more congruency =&gt; more certainty for the user =&gt; more FTDs!

**Example for DE**: We show Germany flag, EUR currency, and Deutsche language. \( Again this is obvious but most affiliate are not doing it as it extra work to update it \)

### What's new - 14 January 2020

Summing things up: cloaking and tracking improvment, better UI and some nice tools to make blackflow easier.

**1\) Better cloaking ðŸ›¡**

* we now have 3 protection layers. Blackflow chained with both **Leadcloak and Traffic armor**. The reason is, their IPs database and what is checked is slightly different, and combining them assure that we just get the best cloaking ever.

  It's an extra step for us, but we know it means a lot to you. Your account will run longer and better.

* cutting edge cloaking method: We now have **reverse proxy** \( fully mirroring an external website to use it as safe page \), curl and redirection \( and lately, it actually works great on facebook! \)

**2\) More accurate tracking ðŸ”—**

Tracking just got more accurate! Previously we were tracking users client side using js, then we realized that on some device we were missing up to 10% of your traffic. Now **we also track server side** for 100% accuracy \( same as other trackers but with the benefit of no-redirect \). We won't miss any of your visitor or click!

**3\) Even Easier ðŸ˜›ðŸ˜›**

We are always working on making blackflow easier to use.
